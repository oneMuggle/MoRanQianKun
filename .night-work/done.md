### Status: FILE NOT FOUND

### Problem

Plan file `docs/plans/2026-04-20_modern-world-event-system.md` does not exist.

### Investigation

1. **Exact path check**: File not found
2. **Wildcard search** (`*2026-04-20*`): No matches
3. **docs/plans/ contents**: Confirmed - file does not exist (~50 plan files in directory)
4. **Git history search**: No commit records
5. **Full repository search** (`modern.*event`, `world.*event`): No relevant plan documents

### Related Files

| File | Relevance |
|------|-----------|
| `docs/plans/2026-04-10_event-trigger-system.md` | Event trigger system v1 |
| `docs/plans/2026-04-21_trigger-system-v2.md` | Trigger system v2 |
| `docs/plans/2026-04-26_era-theme-inheritance.md` | Era theme inheritance |

### Conclusion

**Cannot execute** - Plan file was never created or has been deleted. Task skipped.

## Task: docs/plans/2026-05-06_bdsm-module-analysis-fix.md

**Execution Time**: 2026-05-07 00:32 UTC

### Status: COMPLETED

All 4 phases were already implemented from a previous execution (commit `66b8d5b`):

### Completed Items

| Phase | Step | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 阶段 1: 核心工作流连接 | 1.1-1.4 | ✅ Complete |
| 阶段 2: API 测试验证 | 2.1-2.6 | ✅ Complete |
| 阶段 3: 类型安全修复 | 3.1-3.2 | ✅ Complete |
| 阶段 4: 统一阶段阈值常量 | Constants file | ✅ Complete |

### Key Implementation Evidence

1. **bdsmConstants.ts** - Created at `models/campusNSFW/bdsmConstants.ts` with `BDSM阶段要求` constant
2. **bdsmTaskWorkflow.ts** - Imports `BDSM阶段要求` from constants file (line 17)
3. **useGame.ts** - 5 async action functions implemented (lines 1053-1220):
   - `请求生成BDSM任务`
   - `请求生成BDSM日常指令`
   - `请求评价BDSM任务`
   - `请求生成BDSM契约`
   - `请求判定BDSM阶段推进`
4. **bdsmTaskTrigger.ts** - Fixed to read actual contract info instead of hardcoded `'口头约定'`
5. **类型安全** - 契约记录字段映射修复, 日常指令中文字段 fallback
